[id="{anchor_prefix}-github-com-vshn-espejote-api-v1alpha1-admission"]
==== Admission



Admission is the Schema for the Admissions API.
Admission currently fully relies on cert-manager for certificate management and webhook certificate injection.
See the kustomize overlays for more information.

| *`webhookConfiguration`* __xref:{anchor_prefix}-github-com-vshn-espejote-api-v1alpha1-webhookconfiguration[$$WebhookConfiguration$$]__ | WebhookConfiguration defines the configuration for the Admission webhook. +
Allows fine grained control over what is forwarded to the webhook. +
Note that Admission enforces namespace isolation. The namespaceSelector field is set to the namespace of the Admission and can't be overridden. +
There will be a ClusterAdmission in the future to allow for cluster wide admission control. + |  | 
| *`mutating`* __boolean__ | Mutating defines if the Admission should create a MutatingWebhookConfiguration or a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration. + |  | 
| *`template`* __string__ | Template contains the Jsonnet code to decide the admission result. +
Admission responses should be created using the `espejote.libsonnet` library. +
`esp.ALPHA.admission.allowed("Nice job!")`, `esp.ALPHA.admission.denied("Bad job!")`, `esp.ALPHA.admission.patched("added user annotation", [jsonPatchOp("add", "/metadata/annotations/user", "tom")])` are examples of valid responses. +
The template can reference JsonnetLibrary objects by importing them. +
JsonnetLibrary objects have the following structure: +
- "espejote.libsonnet": The built in library for accessing the context and trigger information. +
- "lib/<NAME>/<KEY>" libraries in the shared library namespace. The name corresponds to the name of the JsonnetLibrary object and the key to the key in the data field. +
The namespace is configured at controller startup and normally points to the namespace of the controller. +
- "<NAME>/<KEY>" libraries in the same namespace as the Admission. The name corresponds to the name of the JsonnetLibrary object and the key to the key in the data field. + |  |

re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. + | false | 
| *`fieldValidation`* __string__ | fieldValidation instructs the managed resource on how to handle +
objects containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: +
- Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently +
dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate +
field that the decoder encounters. +
Note that Jsonnet won't allow you to add duplicate fields to an object +
and most unregistered fields will error out in the server-side apply +
request, even with this option set. +
- Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if +
any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any +
duplicate fields are present. The error returned will contain +
all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. +
Defaults to "Strict". + | Strict | Enum: [Ignore Strict] +

|===
| Field | Description | Default | Validation
| *`rules`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#rulewithoperations-v1-admissionregistration[$$RuleWithOperations$$] array__ | Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. +
The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule. +
However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks +
from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely +
disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called +
on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects. + |  | 
| *`failurePolicy`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#failurepolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[$$FailurePolicyType$$]__ | FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission endpoint are handled - +
allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail. + |  | 
| *`matchPolicy`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#matchpolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[$$MatchPolicyType$$]__ | matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests. +
Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". +

- Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. +
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, +
but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, +
a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. +

- Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. +
For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, +
and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, +
a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook. +

Defaults to "Equivalent" + |  | 
| *`objectSelector`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#labelselector-v1-meta[$$LabelSelector$$]__ | ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the +
object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both +
the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and +
is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null +
object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of +
delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a +
DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to +
match. +
Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end +
users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. +
Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything. + |  | 
| *`reinvocationPolicy`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#reinvocationpolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[$$ReinvocationPolicyType$$]__ | reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation. +
Allowed values are "Never" and "IfNeeded". +

Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a single admission evaluation. +

IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one additional time as part of the admission evaluation +
if the object being admitted is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call. +
Webhooks that specify this option *must* be idempotent, able to process objects they previously admitted. +
Note: +
* the number of additional invocations is not guaranteed to be exactly one. +
* if additional invocations result in further modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again. +
* webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of additional invocations. +
* to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed complete, use a validating admission webhook instead. +

Defaults to "Never". + |  | 
| *`matchConditions`* __link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#matchcondition-v1-admissionregistration[$$MatchCondition$$] array__ | MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be sent to this +
webhook. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, +
namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. +
There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed. +

The exact matching logic is (in order): +
1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the webhook is skipped. +
2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the webhook is called. +
3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE): +
- If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request +
- If failurePolicy=Ignore, the error is ignored and the webhook is skipped + |  |
