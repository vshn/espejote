# About

Espejote was developed by [VSHN AG](https://vshn.ch), a Swiss company specializing in managed Kubernetes and cloud services.
We manage a diverse range of Kubernetes clusters for our customers, from bare-metal OpenShift clusters to managed Kubernetes services from major cloud providers.

After being fed up with maintaining countless controllers and policy engine deployments we [decided to create Espejote](https://kb.vshn.ch/oc4/explanations/decisions/prometheusrule-controller.html).
Espejote was initially developed based on the [initial architecture document](https://kb.vshn.ch/oc4/references/architecture/espejote-in-cluster-templating-controller.html).

Espejote does the heavy lifting for OpenShift customization, many customer self-service use cases, and integrates well with our fleet management toolset [Project Syn](https://syn.tools/syn/index.html).
